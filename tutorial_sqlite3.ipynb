    "- A **database cursor** allows access to rows within a \"results set\" (one or more rows).  The cursor operates on a single row at a time. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)))\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **database transaction** is a \"complete unit of work\" consisting of one or more operations. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction))\n",
    "    - ex, from wiki: Transferring money from one bank acct to another is a single transaction with two operations:\n",
    "        1. Remove money from sender acct\n",
    "        2. Add money to recipient acct\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **ACID** ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID))\n",
    "        - A = *atomic*; must finish completely or, if failure, have no effect on the DB state/data\n",
    "        - C = *consistent*; DB state must maintain consistency - any data written must meet all defined rules (constraints, cascades, triggers, etc.)\n",
    "            - Cascade = sequence of transactions that are rolled back due to a later transaction being rolled back/undone ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollback_(data_management)))\n",
    "            - Trigger = code that is automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table/view ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_trigger))\n",
    "        - I = *isolated*; concurrent transactions leave database in same final state as same set of transactions, executed sequentially\n",
    "        - D = *durable*; once completed, a transaction will remain committed even if system fails (power outage/crash).  Aka, store info to non-volatile memory (hard drive), not RAM.\n",
